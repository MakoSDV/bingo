# Customizable BINGO App

This app creates a set of customizable BINGO games with the BINGO squares and their descriptions read from Google Sheets.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses the [Google Sheets Reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/g-sheets-api) npm package to simplify reading Google Sheets. Be sure to follow the instructions there to properly setup the Sheet for public read access via the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/).
